Welcome to the [Project Name] Arcana knowledge base!

This is where we document our systems, share operational knowledge, and learn from incidents.

<!-- truncate -->

## What Goes Here

### Architecture Docs

System design documentation covering components, data flows, and infrastructure. When you want to understand *what* something is and *why* it works that way, look here.

### Runbooks

Step-by-step operational procedures. When you need to *do* something, look here. Every runbook includes prerequisites, procedures with verification steps, and troubleshooting guides.

### Specs

Protocol and API specifications. Reference material for implementation details.

### Blog Posts

Two types of content:

1. **Incident Reports** - Tagged with `incident`. After resolving an issue, document what happened, how we diagnosed it, and how we fixed it. This helps everyone learn.

2. **Insights** - Anything useful you've learned about the system. Design decisions, gotchas, tips and tricks.

## Contributing

**Update docs when you notice they're wrong.** Code is the source of truth. If docs don't match reality, fix the docs.

**Add incidents after resolving them.** Create a new blog post with the `incident` tag.

**Share what you learn.** If it took you time to figure something out, others will benefit from your documentation.
